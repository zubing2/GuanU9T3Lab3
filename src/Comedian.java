    // it prints: "Let me run this new joke past my agent! Siri, dial 646-555-5555"
    // Then uncomment test code for Exercise 2 in Main.java and test





    // EXERCISE 3: as you saw in exercise 1, when calling a superclass' CONSTRUCTOR from
    // a subclass' constructor, super MUST be the first line of code; is that the case for
    // calls to non-constructor methods in the superclass?
    //

    // the Exercise 4 test code in Main.java prints:
    // "Performing for an audience! Performance #1"
    // followed by EACH joke on a NEW line





    // Exercise 5: PREDICT what this will print when

    // which calls to callAgent produce the same result?  how about to rehearse?

    //EXERCISE 6:  Write an OVERLOADED version of the inherited
    //    rehearse() method with a boolean parameter performAfter;
    //    the method should do the standard rehearsal,
    //    followed by perform if performAfter is true.
